# Laravel Elixir Starter package
An example application of using laravel elixir for non laravel projects.

## Configuring the directory structure
The directory structure can be configured using the elixir.json file available at the root directory.

*NOTE:* If the path overrides do not work due to some reason, you can override them in the gulpfile
directly by setting properties on the elixir.config object.
